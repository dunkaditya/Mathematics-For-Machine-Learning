# Mathematics-for-Machine-Learning
This is a project created by Aditya Reddy, Claire Guo, and Cole Wasserman for a final project for freshman year Discrete Mathematics at New York University.
The aim of the project is to provide an introduction to machine learning and its applications while focusing on the use of mathematics in
creating machine learning models. In this project, we will explore topics such as regression and classification.
We will provide implementations of some of these topics in code and will give mathematical proofs for the convergence of gradient descent and 
the cost function of linear regression.
